          <h1>A first-ever complete map for elastic strain engineering</h1>
          <p>Without a map, it can be just about impossible to know not just where you are, but where you’re going, and that’s
          especially true when it comes to materials properties.
          For decades, scientists have understood that while bulk materials behave in certain ways, those rules can break down for
          materials at the micro- and nano-scales, and often in surprising ways. One of those surprises was the finding that, for
          some materials, applying even modest strains — a concept known as elastic strain engineering — on materials can
          dramatically improve certain properties, provided those strains stay elastic and do not relax away by plasticity,
          fracture, or phase transformations. Micro- and nano-scale materials are especially good at holding applied strains in
          the elastic form.</p>
